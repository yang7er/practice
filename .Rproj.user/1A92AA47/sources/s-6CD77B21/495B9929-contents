In recent years, the world's population has become progressively less fertile, with the global average fertility rate below 2.5 children per woman. Compared to the past fifty years, global fertility has been cut in half. Roser (2020) believed that the three major reasons for lower fertility are the empowerment of women (increased access to education and labor market participation), declining child mortality, and the rising cost of raising children (which is helped by the decline in child labor). In addition, Becker (2010) said that as women increasingly participate in the labour market their opportunity costs for having children are rising so that they seek to have fewer children. In this report, only the correlation between the rise in women's empowerment (increased access to education and labor market participation) and fertility becoming lower will be discussed. This report will analyze and visualize changes in the correlation between fertility rates and women's rights using a year-over-year analysis.
